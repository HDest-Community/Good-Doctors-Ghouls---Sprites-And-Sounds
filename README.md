This is a Zscriptless version of Good Doctor's Ghouls, originally created by Mortis (Discord name is mortis__)
on the Hdest Discord Server, updated with permission. 

Modified by Cryomundus, with a couple added sounds.

For the sake of ease of use and to make maintaining this significantly easier, I opted to mostly achieve the 
same effect as the original by making it dependent on 2 other mods, those being 
[Unique Enemy Sounds by Yholl](https://dastrukar.gitlab.io/hddons-list/#uniqueenemysounds-yholl) and [Visual Zombies by Melodica](https://dastrukar.gitlab.io/hddons-list/#visualzombies-melodica). 

The load order for this to work correctly should be:
1. hd_uniquesounds.pk3
2. mld_visualzombies_noncl.pk3
3. Good-Doctors-Ghouls---Sprites-And-Sounds-main.zip
